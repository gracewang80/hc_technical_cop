## First meeting:

Dec 5th, 2019

Proposed Agenda:

1.	Round table 
    
    Where do you work?
    
    What programming software do you use at work?
    
    What are you interested in learning through this community of practice?
    
2.	Purpose and structure of the technical community of practice
    
    2.1. Discussion on potential topics
    
    2.2. Software for data science

3.	Dashboard presentation

4.	Suggestions / next presentation 


Potential software:

- R	Programming Language:	A programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis

- RStudio	Analytics Tool:	A set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R eg. data mining and statistical analysis of large data sets.

- Python	Programming Language:	Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python has emerged over the past few years as a leader in data science programming.

- Anaconda 	Programming Language:	Free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment (Pycharm, Spyder, VScode).

- SQLite 	Relational database management system: 	A relational database management system contained in a C library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a client–server database engine, but is embedded into the end program.

- SQLite Studio	Analytics Tool	A set of integrated tools designed to enhance the features of SQLite.

- Power BI desktop	Analytics Tool	Interactive data visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.  Most users use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then use the Power BI service to share their reports with others.

- Tableau	Analytics Tool	Tableau provides real-time data query and visualization used for business intelligence, big data and general analytics.  Tableau is designed to facilitate real-time “conversations” between data across multiple platforms, like relational databases, cloud data stores, spreadsheets, etc.

- Elasticsearch + Kibana	Analytics Tool	Elasticsearch is a popular enterprise search engine.   Kibana is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.

- SPSS	Analytics Tool	The IBM SPSS® software platform offers advanced statistical analysis, a vast library of machine-learning algorithms, text analysis, open-source extensibility, integration with big data and seamless deployment into applications.

- SAS	Analytics Tool	Through innovative analytics, BI and data management software and services, SAS helps turn your data into better decisions. HC context - IMSD has just modernized the SAS Grid and has a concurrent license for the hundreds of Grid users across the Department (SAS EG) which also includes access to the module SAS Visual Analytics – advanced users prefer PC SAS and currently purchase it separately/independently.

- Stata	Analytics Tool	Stata is the solution for your data science needs. Obtain and manipulate data. Explore. Visualize. Model. Make inferences. Collect your results into reproducible reports. HC context - this is a niche software that is mostly used in SPB’s PREA group who purchase it individually.

- Sudaan	Analytics Tool	This software is especially useful for survey data and is used by analysts in HECSB.

- PostgresSQL 	Relational database management system	Free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance. A more sophisticated and scalable database system over SQLite.

- Git for Windows: Tool for version control.

- Sublime text editor with Python extension.

- VS Code text editor with Python extension.

- Access to the command terminal: extremely important to install packages in Python through pip installation.
